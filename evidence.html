    	heat-trapping gas, or greenhouse gas, that comes from the <br> extraction and burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, <br> and natural gas),from wildfires, and from natural processes like volcanic eruptions. Since the beginning of industrial times (in the <br> 18th century), human activities have raised atmospheric CO2 by <br> 50% – meaning the amount of CO2 is now 150% of its value in 1750. <br>This is greater than what naturally happened at the end of the <br> last ice age 20,000 years ago. This sharp rise in CO2 is the most important climate change driver over the last century.

    	Global mean sea level provides an integrative measure of the state of the climate system, encompassing both the ocean and cryosphere (ice covered portions of Earth), and it can be viewed as an important indicator of what is happening to the climate in the present and what may happen in the future. Long-term changes in global mean sea level (GMSL) are predominantly driven by three processes:
      Ice Melt, Thermal Expansion, Land Water Storage

    <p style="color: white; font-family:Bebas Neue; font-size: 30px;">Degree Celsius since Preindustrial. Earth’s global average surface temperature in 2020 statistically tied with 2016 as the hottest year on record, continuing a long-term warming trend due to human activities. While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. The greenhouse effect is essential to life on Earth, but human-made emissions in the atmosphere are trapping and slowing heat loss to space. Five key greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons, and water vapor. While the Sun has played a role in past climate changes, the evidence shows the current warming cannot be explained by the Sun.</p>
